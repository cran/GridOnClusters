Description: Discretize multivariate continuous data using a grid
 that captures the joint distribution via preserving clusters in
 the original data (Wang et al. 2020) <doi:10.1145/3388440.3412415>.
 Joint grid discretization is applicable as a data transformation step
 to prepare data for model-free inference of association, function, or
 causality.
