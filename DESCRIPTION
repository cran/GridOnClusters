Description: Discretize multivariate continuous data using a grid
 to capture the joint distribution that preserves clusters in
 original data. It can handle both labeled or unlabeled data.
 Both published methods (Wang et al 2020) <doi:10.1145/3388440.3412415>
 and new methods are included. Joint grid discretization
 can prepare data for model-free inference of association,
 function, or causality.
